Services We Provide
Successful IT adoption requires strategic planning, solution design, deployment and on-going support. At iCallidus, we bring together leaders in strategy, business, and technology to co-create your unique path to transformation. Let us help you improve your business performance and turning risk and compliance into opportunities for enhanced value.
In every industry, leaders are faced with challenge of responding to disruptive forces that are fundamentally changing how customers, partners, and employees interact with products and services. Digital technologies continue to reshape markets and industries. Leaders must establish a new strategy for creating value — fueled by data, taking advantage of exponential technologies at scale and leveraging the organization’s differentiating expertise and capabilities.
Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the customer experience, automate processes, improve analytics, forecast demand more accurately for deeper insight and understanding in your organization. Fast, high quality access to AI services enables organizations to deliver faster, better, deeper and new insights that streamline and automate processes to generate operational efficiencies and improve the user experience.
You rely on your systems and technologies for a safe, secure, and dependable method for providing services and supporting your agency mission. Your focus, the results obtained from quality technical deliverables and project planning requirements. And to reduce risk and improve operational performance on your program, you need an integrated program management solutions that delivers the people, processes, and technology to execute on-time and within budget.
Organizations are struggling with aging, complex legacy applications as they sit on the outdated technology, overlapping, processes, and substantial support and maintenance costs. To provide the level of insight required to help you correctly modernize your applications, an in-depth analysis is required to understand the risk and complexity of the desired modernization method. You must consider application lifecycle, technology, infrastructure, performance, and operations and monitoring.
Overhauling your product and services development and delivery process at the organizational level can help ensure digital success. Organizations have already undergone several “transformations”, from the siloed waterfall approach to Agile Methodology and now DevSecOps. Software Delivery is a key differentiator in the age of digital transformation, and scaling Agile and DevSecOps can shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery of applications.
Today’s organizations face an explosion of data from more sources than ever before. Failure to correctly address big data challenges can result in escalating costs, as well as reduced productivity and competitiveness. As a result, many organizations are rethinking their approach to traditional enterprise storage and architecture to utilize and strategize with big data technologies to reduce costs and gain operational efficiencies. As needs for data insights increase, so does the need for big data.
Large enterprise organizations have multiple business-critical applications. IT teams and budgets are constantly tied up maintaining these legacy systems. Migration converts legacy systems to decrease IT complexity and costs, surge data consistency, enable cross-platform collaboration, and improve process flexibility. Options include rehosting, replatforming, refactoring, rearchitecting, rebuilding or replacing legacy systems to deliver latest technology at the best value.
As technologies advance and businesses evolve, legacy systems become the bottleneck to growth instead of drivers of it. Without the right strategy for integration, you face the risk of creating silos of incompatible legacy and modern systems that do not align. Integration bridges the gap between legacy and modern IT infrastructures to speed projects and bring greater agility to operations. Simply put, integration makes modernization work.
Every interaction with your users is an opportunity, and to your users the interface is you. Every touchpoint is a chance to engage your users in an impactful and meaningful way. So, when your service or product fails, it’s almost never because the interface wasn’t beautiful. Instead, it fails because it was designed to meet the needs of your users. Remove the barriers between you and your users.
Traditionally, organizations used business intelligence to develop a detailed picture of a business and its current state. Today, modern business intelligence solutions must support any use case, empowering users with free-form exploration, powerful AI, & actionable insights. Forward-thinking enterprises are moving past IT-led BI and analytics solutions for offerings that can be managed autonomously by the end-user. Welcome to the next generation of business intelligence.
For many organizations, the rapid rise of digital has pushed IT to the top of the priority list–transforming it from a cost-center to strategic enabler. Today organizations must also provide employees with the same standard of IT support that they provide to their external users. How do you deliver an outstanding user experience in an increasingly complex IT environment, where people work at any time, in any place, and on any device?
Business rules represent your organization’s policies, practices and specific technical languages used to execute your legacy applications. These rules are rarely if ever documented outside the applications and are often not fully understood. Lack of system documentation and unavailability of experts are major roadblocks in the transformation journey. Business Rule Extraction helps catalog embedded business logic and dependencies to improve the accuracy of your application.
For today’s enterprise, success or failure is tied directly to the effectiveness of their IT service delivery environments and the cloud is the agent of digital disruption. It is the foundational enabler of digital transformation projects and offers the scale and speed that is needed for organizations to focus on transformation; with a clear impact on the role of IT. And as IT increasingly needs to support changing business priorities while reducing the risks of wasted IT resources, the cloud is indispensable.

What is Application Modernization?
Implement Modernization Methodically and Avoid Business Disruption Through:
Legacy applications provide business-critical functions within the enterprise application landscape but incur large operations and maintenance costs. Additionally, they pose a number of challenges including unsupported hardware and software, inflexible and closed architectures, lack of integration, and limited technical resources. When your organization is challenged by legacy applications, you need to know how much of an overhaul or commitment modernization will take. Your systems should be aligned, reliable and compatible, while cutting down on excess work and overlapping processes that slow you down.
